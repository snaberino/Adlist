# Blocklists for Technitium DNS

I put this together to clean up my home network by blocking ads, trackers, and telemetry with [Technitium DNS Server](https://technitium.com/dns/). This repo contains a merged blocklist—either `merged.hosts` and `merged.domains` or split into parts like `merged_hosts_part1.txt`, `merged_hosts_part2.txt`, etc.—designed to make your internet cleaner and more private.



## This blocklist is built from 31 sources, optimized to remove duplicates and redundancies. It covers:

- Ads: Banner ads, pop-ups, and other annoyances on websites.
- Trackers: Analytics and tracking scripts that follow you online.
- Social Media: Widgets and trackers from social platforms.
- Device-Specific Telemetry: Tracking from devices like Xiaomi, Samsung, Apple, Amazon, Roku, LG TVs, and more.
- Platform-Specific: Filters to reduce ads on platforms like YouTube.

## Why This Blocklist?

I created this because fetching 31 separate blocklists was bogging down my Technitium server with too many requests. By merging them into one or a few files and cutting out duplicates and overlaps, I got a blocklist that’s just as effective but way easier on the server. It’s formatted for Technitium’s hosts-based blocking, updated daily, and keeps your network fast and private.


## Contributing
This is my personal setup, but I’m open to suggestions. Got ideas for better blocklists or ways to reduce false positives? Open an issue and reach out.

## Troubleshooting
- **False Positives/Blocked Sites**: Some legit domains might get blocked. Use Technitium’s Allowlist to fix issues.
- **Fetch Errors?**: Test the raw GitHub URLs in a browser to ensure they’re accessible.
